"raop_play"

This is originally a ported version of "JustePort" which is programed
by Jon Lech Johansen.  I've rewritten it in C code using openssl, so
this can run without mono.

This program works under aexcl_play which makes GUI.

Thomas Butter gave me information how to play pcm data, and now this
can play wave files.

The original information about alac format from alac_decoder
by David Hamilton.  http://craz.net/programs/itunes/alac.html

mp3, ogg, aac data are supported by using commandline program:
"mpg321","ogg123" and "faad".


TO COMPILE:
Make sure you have libssl library and header file.
Then just run "make", you'll get an executable "raop_play".
No installer is there, If you want to put into a executable path, you
need to manually copy it.

TO PLAY:
$ raop_play [--port port_number] [--vol volume(0-100)] [-i] AirporExpree_IP [ filename ]

Supported filetypes:
.pcm .wav, .mp3, .m4a, .ogg, .aac, .pls, http://*
  .pls is playlist which includes other type of file as a list.
  if filename start with "http://", which is plyed by mpg321.  Only mp3 type streams can be played
  files without extension are played as raw pcm data file, which can be fifo or file device.


if -i option is used, the program stops after making a connection, and
wait a command from stdin.

INTERACTIVE MODE COMMAND:

  play [m4a_filename] # play-after-pause doesn't need m4a_filename
  pause
  stop
  quit
  volume VALUE # VALUE is 0 to 100

INTERACTIVE MODE CONSOLE PRINTOUT:
  connected # when it gets a connection with the host
  done # when one file play finished
  error # non fatal error. if it is fatal, disconnect and quit the program.
